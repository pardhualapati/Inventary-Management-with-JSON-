# Inventary-Management-with-JSON-

The Inventory Management project is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage product inventory for a business. The program uses JSON files to store and access the inventory data, making it easy to maintain and update the product records.

Upon execution, the program displays a user-friendly menu, showcasing the available products along with their corresponding names, prices, and quantities. Users can then input their details, including name, email, phone number, product ID, and desired quantity, to make a purchase.

The application checks the availability of the requested product and verifies if the inventory has sufficient quantity to fulfill the order. If there is enough stock, it generates a bill with the product name, price, and total cost, and updates the inventory quantity after the purchase. Additionally, it records the user's purchase details, such as name, email, phone number, product ID, quantity, total cost, and purchase timestamp, in the sales.txt file.

In cases where the inventory has less quantity than the user's requirement, the application prompts the user to purchase the available quantity or wait for more stock. If the user chooses to proceed, it generates a bill and updates the inventory accordingly.

The application ensures data integrity by using JSON format to represent the inventory data, making it easy to add, modify, or retrieve information about products. It provides a seamless and interactive experience for users and assists businesses in effectively managing their inventory and sales records.

In summary, the Inventory Management project simplifies the inventory control process, streamlines business operations, and optimizes stock tracking, thereby facilitating better decision-making for businesses of all sizes.
